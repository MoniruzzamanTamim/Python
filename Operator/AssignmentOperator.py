# Basic assignment
x = 10
print("x =", x)  # Output: 10

# Add and assign
x += 5  # Equivalent to: x = x + 5
print("x += 5 -->", x)  # Output: 15

# Subtract and assign
x -= 3  # Equivalent to: x = x - 3
print("x -= 3 -->", x)  # Output: 12

# Multiply and assign
x *= 2  # Equivalent to: x = x * 2
print("x *= 2 -->", x)  # Output: 24

# Divide and assign
x /= 4  # Equivalent to: x = x / 4
print("x /= 4 -->", x)  # Output: 6.0

# Modulus and assign
x %= 5  # Equivalent to: x = x % 5
print("x %= 5 -->", x)  # Output: 1.0

# Exponent and assign
x **= 3  # Equivalent to: x = x ** 3
print("x **= 3 -->", x)  # Output: 1.0

# Floor divide and assign
x //= 2  # Equivalent to: x = x // 2
